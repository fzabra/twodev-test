## TWO DEV TEST

You should implement the page on Figma using react, and copy the header, footer and other elements from avril.2dev.ca.

Figma Page --> Frontend Test - PWA
Password: Abcd.1234

Try to keep it the most similar possible with the online version and figma layout, also taking responsiveness in consideration.
You should implement the main navigation, using the same graphql requests avril.2dev.ca is using. The server is configured to allow requests by any host, so you will not have any CORS errors. Other dynamic elements (cart, my account, etc) are facultative.

If anything is needed or in case of any difficulty please contact dionei@2dev.ca, we'll answer quickly.
